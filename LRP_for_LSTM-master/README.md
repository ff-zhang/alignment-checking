# Description

This repository provides a **reference** implementation of **Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) for LSTMs**, as initially proposed in the paper [*Explaining Recurrent Neural Network Predictions in Sentiment Analysis, L. Arras, G. Montavon, K.-R. Müller and W. Samek* WASSA@EMNLP'2017](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/W17-5221) [[arXiv:1706.07206](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07206)].

Additionally it includes an implementation of **Sensitivity Analysis (SA)** and **Gradient x Input (GI)**, i.e. of gradient-based relevances.

Note that our implementation is generic and can be easily extended to unidirectional LSTMs, or to other application domains than Natural Language Processing. 

A few hints on how to apply and extend the code to your needs can be found [here](./DOC.md).



## Dependencies

Python>=3.5 + Numpy + Matplotlib, or alternatively, simply install Anaconda.

Using conda, you can e.g. create a Python 3.6 environment: conda create -n py36 python=3.6 anaconda

Then activate it with: source activate py36

Before being able to use the code, you might need to run in the terminal: export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$pwd



## Usage

The folder model/ contains a word-based bidirectional LSTM model, that was trained for five-class sentiment prediction of phrases and sentences on the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html) dataset, as released by the authors in *[Visualizing and Understanding Neural Models in NLP, J. Li, X. Chen, E. Hovy and D. Jurafsky, 2016](https://github.com/jiweil/Visualizing-and-Understanding-Neural-Models-in-NLP)*

The folder data/ contains the test set sentences of the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html), preprocessed by lowercasing, as was done in *[Visualizing and Understanding Neural Models in NLP, J. Li, X. Chen, E. Hovy and D. Jurafsky, 2016](https://github.com/jiweil/Visualizing-and-Understanding-Neural-Models-in-NLP)*

The notebook run_example.ipynb provides a usage example of the code, its performs LRP, SA and GI on a test sentence.<br/>
